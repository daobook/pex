"You can build .pex files using the ``pex`` utility, which is made "

"This command creates a pex file containing pex and requests, using the "

"any virtualenv."

"The ``pex`` utility has no required arguments and by default will "

"of the ``pex`` command invocation and is garbage collected immediately on"
" exit."

"You can tailor which interpreter is used by specifying ``--python=PATH``."
"  PATH can be either the absolute path of a Python binary or the name of "

"Requirements are specified using the same form as expected by ``pip`` and"

"Conveniently, the output of ``pip freeze`` (a list of pinned "

"As mentioned above, if no entry points are specified, the default "

"Entry points can also take the form ``package:target``, such as "
"``sphinx:main`` or ``fabric.main:main`` for Sphinx and Fabric "
"respectively.  This is roughly equivalent to running a script that does "
"``import sys, from package import target; sys.exit(target())``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../buildingpex.rst:198

"This can be a powerful way to invoke Python applications without ever "

#: ../../buildingpex.rst:214
msgid ""
"Although sys.exit is applied blindly to the return value of the target "

"If you don't know the ``package:target`` for the console scripts of your "
