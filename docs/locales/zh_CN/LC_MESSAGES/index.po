"pex contains the Python packaging and distribution libraries originally "
"available through the `twitter commons "
"<https://github.com/twitter/commons>`_ but since split out into a "
"separate project. The most notable components of pex are the .pex (Python"
" EXecutable) format and the associated ``pex`` tool which provide a "
"general purpose Python environment virtualization solution similar in "
"spirit to `virtualenv <http://virtualenv.org>`_.  PEX files have been "
"used by Twitter to deploy Python applications to production since 2011."
